## 3. Introduction

Explain why this project exists, the problem it solves, and its primary goals.

> **Example**  
> This project is a reference implementation showing how to build, test, and deploy a .NET Core application using Azure DevOps. We leverage a fully automated pipeline for both Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), ensuring code quality, reliability, and speed of delivery.

---

## 4. Architecture Overview

Provide a high-level overview or diagram of the system’s architecture, focusing on how your application, services, databases, and Azure DevOps pipelines interact.

- **Diagram**: Include a simple diagram (using tools like draw.io, Lucidchart, or a markdown-based ASCII diagram) that illustrates how the code flows from GitHub into Azure DevOps, through build, test, and deployment stages, and eventually into the target environment(s).  
- **Key Components**: Highlight each component (e.g., web app, database, Azure DevOps pipelines, test harness, etc.) and its role.

---

## 5. Project Structure

Outline the important folders and files in your repository. Emphasize how each part relates to the CI/CD process.

> **Example**  
> ```bash
> .
> ├── .github/                  # (If using GitHub Actions for integration or referencing GitHub workflows)
> ├── azure-pipelines/          # Directory containing Azure Pipeline YAML files
> ├── src/                      # Application source code
> │   ├── Controllers/          # Web API or MVC controllers
> │   ├── Models/               # Data models
> │   └── Services/             # Business logic
> ├── tests/                    # Unit tests and integration tests
> ├── Dockerfile                # Docker configuration (if containerizing)
> ├── azure-pipelines.yml       # Example main pipeline definition file
> └── README.md                 # Project documentation

## 6. Prerequisites

List what is needed before someone can successfully run or contribute to the project:

- **Tools**: .NET SDK, Node.js, Azure CLI, Docker, etc.  
- **Azure DevOps**: Valid account with appropriate permissions to create pipelines and releases.  
- **GitHub Access**: Permissions to clone/push/pull from this repository.  
- **IDE**: (Optional) Visual Studio, VSCode, or IntelliJ, whichever is relevant.

---

## 7. Azure DevOps CI/CD Overview

Give an overview of the CI/CD pipeline stages and how they are organized in Azure DevOps.

### 7.1. Continuous Integration (CI)

- **Triggering**: Describe how CI is triggered (e.g., on every push to `main` or via pull requests).  
- **Goals**: Explain code compilation, unit tests, linting, static code analysis, etc.

### 7.2. Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)

- **Promotion Through Stages**: Development → Testing → Production.  
- **Approvals & Gates**: State any manual approval gates or automated checks.

---

## 8. Branching Strategy

Explain the branching methodology your team follows to maintain clean merges and reduce conflicts.

- **Common Strategies**:  
  - **GitFlow**: Feature branches, develop branch, release branches.  
  - **GitHub Flow**: Single main branch, feature branches, PR-based merges.  
  - **Trunk-Based Development**: Short-lived feature branches, rapid merges to main.  

Explain how this ties into your pipeline triggers. For example:

> Pull requests to `develop` branch trigger the CI pipeline. Merges to `main` branch trigger both CI and a release to staging.

---

## 9. Build Pipeline

Detail how your build pipeline is structured in Azure DevOps.

1. **Pipeline Definition**: Provide a snippet of the YAML file (`azure-pipelines.yml`) and briefly explain each stage.  
2. **Stages**: 
   - *Compile/Build:* Tools used for build (e.g., .NET build tasks).  
   - *Unit Tests:* Testing frameworks, how coverage is measured.  
   - *Code Analysis:* SonarQube or any other static code analysis tools.  
   - *Artifact Packaging:* How artifacts (e.g., .zip files, Docker images) are produced and stored in Azure Artifacts or a registry.

> **Example Snippet**  
> ```yaml
> trigger:
>   branches:
>     include:
>       - main
>       - develop
>
> pool:
>   vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
>
> steps:
> - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
>   inputs:
>     command: 'build'
>     projects: '**/*.csproj'
>
> - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
>   inputs:
>     command: 'test'
>     projects: '**/*Tests/*.csproj'
> ```
  
Explain how to customize or extend these steps.

## 10. Release Pipeline

Detail the release pipeline that handles deployment to various environments. If you are using multi-stage YAML pipelines, clarify the release stages in the same YAML. If you are using classic release pipelines in Azure DevOps, describe the environment definitions and how artifacts are deployed.

- **Stages/Environments**: Development, Staging, Production.  
- **Deployment Method**: Web App Deploy task, Kubernetes deployment, or Container Registry push.  
- **Approvals and Checks**: Automated or manual approvals for production.  
- **Rollback Strategy**: Mention how you roll back if a deployment fails (e.g., revert to a previous release).

---

## 11. Testing and Quality Checks

Explain the testing strategy used within the CI pipeline and any other quality checks:

- **Unit Tests**: Framework and coverage thresholds.  
- **Integration Tests**: How and when they are executed.  
- **Security Scans**: SAST, DAST, container scans, etc.  
- **Linting/Formatting**: Tools like ESLint, StyleCop, Prettier, etc.

---

## 12. Environment Variables and Secrets

Detail how environment-specific configuration is handled and how secrets are managed securely:

- **Azure Key Vault**: If used, describe how secrets are retrieved.  
- **Variable Groups**: If using Azure DevOps variable groups, list important variables and usage.  
- **Local Development**: Provide guidelines for using `.env` files or local environment settings while keeping secrets safe.

---

## 13. Monitoring and Logging

If applicable, describe how you monitor the health of your application and pipelines:

- **Application Insights**: Real-time monitoring for Azure-hosted apps.  
- **Log Aggregation**: Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, or third-party tools.  
- **Alerts**: Automated alerts for failed builds, service downtime, etc.

---

## 14. Troubleshooting

Provide common problems and their known solutions:

> **Examples**  
> - **Build Failures**: Missing NuGet packages, solution not compiling.  
> - **Release Errors**: Incorrect service connection, permission denied.  
> - **Access Denied**: Azure DevOps permissions misconfiguration.

---

## 15. Best Practices

Offer recommendations and lessons learned:

- **Pull Request Reviews**: Require at least one reviewer before merging.  
- **Automated Tests**: All merges must pass tests.  
- **Versioning**: Use SemVer or another clear versioning strategy.  
- **Security**: Use secure variable storage, enforce SSL, update dependencies regularly.

---

## 16. Contributing

Guidelines for how others can contribute:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Describe the process.  
2. **Create a Feature Branch**: Follow your team’s branching policy.  
3. **Commit and Push**: Use meaningful commit messages.  
4. **Pull Request**: Use templates, link to relevant issues, pass CI checks.  
5. **Reviews**: Explain the review process and how merges are finalized.

---

## 17. License

Include your project's license details. For example:

> This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for details.

---

## 18. Contact Information

Provide ways to reach the maintainers or team members:

- **Project Maintainer**: Name, email, or Slack channel.  
- **Support Channels**: GitHub Issues, Microsoft Teams channel, etc.

---

### Final Notes

- **Use Visual Aids**: Add screenshots or diagrams of the Azure DevOps pipelines as necessary.  
- **Keep Documentation Updated**: Revise the documentation whenever your pipeline or project structure changes.  
- **Wiki or `docs/` Folder**: Larger projects may benefit from more detailed docs in a separate folder or a GitHub Wiki.  
- **Automate Where Possible**: Consider using badges (build status, test coverage) and auto-generated release notes.
